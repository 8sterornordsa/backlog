The album also introduces the recurring character of Damien, a demonic alter ego who tempts DMX with fame and fortune in exchange for his soul. The album explores themes of violence, crime, religion, love, and betrayal, with DMX's personal struggles and experiences as the main inspiration.
 
"It's Dark And Hell Is Hot" was a commercial and critical success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and selling over five million copies in the US. It received rave reviews from critics who praised DMX's authenticity, charisma, and lyrical skills. The album also established DMX as a leader of the Ruff Ryders collective, a group of rappers and producers who dominated the hip hop scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

DMX also inspired many other rappers who followed his footsteps, such as Ja Rule, 50 Cent, Eminem, and The Game.

He was also a devout Christian who often prayed and read the Bible on stage.
 
DMX's legacy is undeniable, as he is widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. He is one of the best-selling rap artists ever, with over 74 million records sold worldwide.
