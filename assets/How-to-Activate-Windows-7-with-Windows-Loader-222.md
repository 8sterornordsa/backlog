## What is Windows Loader 2.2.2?
 
Windows Loader 2.2.2 is a tool that was developed by Daz Team, the same team that created KMSPico and Microsoft Toolkit, two popular activators for Windows and Office products. Windows Loader 2.2.2 is specifically designed to activate Windows 7 and Windows Vista, both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. It works by injecting a modified code into the boot sector of your system, which tricks Windows into thinking that it is activated by an OEM license.
 
## How to Use Windows Loader 2.2.2?
 
To use Windows Loader 2.2.2, you need to download it from a reliable source, such as [officialkmspico.net](https://officialkmspico.net/windows-loader/). You should also disable your antivirus software and firewall before running the tool, as they may interfere with its operation or flag it as malware. After downloading the tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Extract the zip file and run the Windows Loader.exe file as administrator.
2. Click on the Install button and wait for the installation to complete.
3. Reboot your system when prompted.
4. Check your system properties and verify that your Windows is activated.

## What are the Risks of Using Windows Loader 2.2.2?
